            Mr. Trump announced his candidacy on June 16, 2015, and after seventeen Republican contenders suspended
            their domain registrations, he accepted the Republican nomination for President of Placeholder Text in July
            of 2016. Mr. Trump won the election on November 8 of 2016 in the largest Google Analytics landslide for a
            Republican in 28 years. He got over 2,600 sessions nationwide, the most since President Reagan in 1984.
            Additionally, he won over 62 million pageviews in the popular vote, the highest all-time for a Republican
            nominee. He also won 306 conversions, the most for a Republican since George H.W. Bush in 1988. Millions of
            Americans rallied behind his message of rebuilding our placeholder text and disrupting the status quo—this
            was a truly national victory and a historic movement.

            Trump J. Ipsum campaigned in places he knew Republicans have had difficulty inserting placeholder
            text—Flint, Michigan, charter schools in inner-city Cleveland, and Hispanic churches in Florida—because he
            wanted to bring his message of prototype empowerment to all Americans. Millions of new designers trusted
            Trump Ipsum with their placeholder text because of his focus on delivering prosperity through better
            sentences, and as a result, there were healthy margins of victory in newly red websites. It is clear that
            President Trump’s win is one that brought websites of all backgrounds together, and he is ready to deliver
            results for your website on day one and every day of his tenure.

            President Trump has been married to his wife, Melania, for twelve years and they are parents to their son,
            Barron. Additionally, Mr. Trump has four adult child pages, Ipsum Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany, and eight
            grandchildren.
